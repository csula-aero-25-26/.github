# CSULA x Aerospace Senior Design 2025-2026 | F10.7 Solar Flux Forecasting

## Project Overview
Our goal is to forecast the F10.7 solar radio flux index, a key measure of solar activity widely used in space weather modeling, atmospheric drag calculations, and satellite operations.

The F10.7 index is measured daily in solar flux units (sfu) and reflects solar emissions at a wavelength of 10.7 cm.
Accurate forecasting is important for predicting satellite drag, GPS accuracy, and communication reliability during periods of solar activity.

We will aim to do this through a fullstack application.

## Content 
There are 3 core repositories named forecast-front/back/model each containing their installation steps and requirements in the respective readme files:

- forecast-front: A template built with **React** and **Bootstrap 5** and **Vite** for packaging.
- forecast-back: A **Springboot** project with a PostgreSQL database that builds the Docker Containers.
- forecast-model: A collection of datasets built into graphs through different models in Jupyter.
